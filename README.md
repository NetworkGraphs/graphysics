# graphysics
Graph with Physics, No nodes overlap, morph nodes to properties and groups

# Features

# Features details
* stochastic centrality placement
* mouse drag nodes

# Features Plan
* Update Graph
  * startup Demo
  * Right click and select samples
  * Drag and drop .graphml .Graphson
  * Query Gremlin server
* svg full screen
  * vertices menu
  * context menu
* Mouse actions
  * highlight neighbors
  * bring neighbors closer
  * reference node centrality layout of the whole graph
  * reference node / edge Gremlin query
* Swap between :
  * proprties
  * nodes
  * groups
* Hierarchical and cross Grouping

## Plan details
* highlight node and neighbors on mouse hover
* edges with polylines and arrows
* edges labels on path
* multi-edges

# Development details
* Matter js as physics engine
* svr render base, no update
